Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-12-28
Author: Kosei Kawaguchi a.k.a. KKTeX

Description:
------------
This package provides the command \mhrule, \mvrule and \undernote.
\mhrule and \mvrule are based on \hrule and \vrule, but they can take keyvalue options in order to change its color and style.
\undernote is for attaching short annotations beneath words or phrases in the main text, connected by a ruled line, which internally uses \mhrule and \mvrule.
These command can also be used in vertical writing mode. For example, 
  \documentclass[tate]{jlreq} 
is acceptable.
